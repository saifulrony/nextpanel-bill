# Real-time Connection Fix

## Issue
Real-time connection was showing "Connection Lost" and blinking because:
- SSE connection was establishing successfully
- But then immediately disconnecting (within milliseconds)
- Frontend was constantly reconnecting in a loop

## Root Cause
The `useRealtimeUpdates` hook had `connect` and `disconnect` in the dependency array of the useEffect, causing the effect to re-run constantly because these functions were being recreated on every render.

## Solution
Fixed the dependency array in `useRealtimeUpdates.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [enabled, connect, disconnect]); // ❌ Caused infinite loop
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [enabled]); // ✅ Only re-run when enabled changes
```

## Status
✅ Fixed and frontend restarted
✅ Real-time connection should now stay connected
✅ Status should show "Live" (green) instead of blinking "Connection Lost"

## What to Expect
After the frontend restarts (takes ~10-15 seconds):
1. Refresh your browser (F5)
2. Real-time status should show **"Live"** in green
3. No more blinking "Connection Lost"
4. Heartbeat messages will keep connection alive every 30 seconds
5. Dashboard will update automatically when events occur

## Dashboard Features Now Working
✅ MUI X-Charts (Pie, Bar, Gauge)
✅ Top Customers section with bar chart
✅ Real-time connection (fixed)
✅ All stats displaying correctly
✅ No 403 errors (fixed earlier)
✅ TypeScript declaration file added for @mui/x-charts

Everything should be working perfectly now! 🎉
