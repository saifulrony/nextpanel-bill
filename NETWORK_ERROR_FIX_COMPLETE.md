# Network Error Fix - Complete

## Issue
The frontend was experiencing a **Network Error** when trying to access dashboard endpoints:

```
AxiosError: Network Error
Source: src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx (49:50)
```

## Root Cause
The backend Docker container was failing to start due to a missing Python dependency:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

The `requests` library was added to `requirements.txt` but the Docker container was not rebuilt, so the dependency was not installed in the container.

## Solution

### Step 1: Verified the Problem
```bash
docker logs billing-backend --tail 50
# Showed: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Failed with connection refused (backend not running)
```

### Step 2: Confirmed Dependencies
- Verified `requests==2.32.3` was present in `/billing-backend/requirements.txt` (line 26)
- The container just needed to be rebuilt to install it

### Step 3: Rebuilt Backend Container
```bash
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill
docker-compose build backend
```

### Step 4: Recreated Container
```bash
docker-compose stop backend
docker-compose rm -f backend
docker-compose up -d backend
```

### Step 5: Verified Fix
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","database":"connected","timestamp":"..."}

# Dashboard endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/dashboard/stats
# Response: {"detail":"Not authenticated"} ← This is correct! The endpoint is working.
```

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The backend is now running successfully and all API endpoints are accessible. The "Network Error" in the frontend should now be resolved.

## What Changed
1. Backend Docker container rebuilt with all dependencies including `requests`
2. Container recreated to use the new image
3. All services now running properly:
   - ✅ billing-backend (port 8001)
   - ✅ billing-frontend (port 4000)
   - ✅ billing-redis (port 6379)
   - ✅ billing-postgres (port 5432)

## Next Steps
The frontend should now be able to successfully communicate with the backend. Refresh your browser and the dashboard should load without the Network Error.

If you still see the error:
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear localStorage** if needed
3. Ensure you're logged in with valid credentials
4. Check browser console for any new errors
