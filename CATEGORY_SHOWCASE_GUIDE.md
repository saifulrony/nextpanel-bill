# Browse by Category Section - Complete Guide

## Overview
A new "Browse by Category" section has been added to the homepage, displaying all your active products organized by their categories with beautiful filtering tabs.

## What It Does

### 🎯 Features:
- **Category Tabs** - Filter products by category with one click
- **Product Count** - Shows how many products in each category
- **"All Products" View** - See everything at once
- **Product Cards** - Beautiful cards with pricing and features
- **Add to Cart** - Direct cart integration
- **Category Badges** - Visual category indicators
- **Featured Stars** - Shows which products are featured
- **Responsive Grid** - Adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size

## How It Works

### Automatic Organization
Products are **automatically organized by their category** based on the `category` field in their `features` JSON.

**No manual configuration needed!** The section:
1. Loads all active products from database
2. Groups them by category
3. Shows tabs for categories that have products
4. Hides empty categories

### Category Assignment
When you create/edit a product in `/dashboard/products`, the category is set in the product's features. The homepage automatically picks this up.

## Advanced Features

### Category-Specific Styling

You can add custom styling per category:

```tsx
// In product card (line 470):
const getCategoryColor = (categoryId: string) => {
  const colors = {
    hosting: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700',
    domain: 'bg-green-100 text-green-700',
    ssl: 'bg-purple-100 text-purple-700',
    email: 'bg-pink-100 text-pink-700',
  };
  return colors[categoryId] || 'bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-700';
};

// Then use it:
<span className={`inline-block px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full ${getCategoryColor(product.features?.category)}`}>
```

### Add Category Icons

```tsx
import { ServerIcon, GlobeAltIcon, LockClosedIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';

const getCategoryIcon = (categoryId: string) => {
  const icons = {
    hosting: ServerIcon,
    domain: GlobeAltIcon,
    ssl: LockClosedIcon,
    // ... add more
  };
  return icons[categoryId] || ServerIcon;
};

// In category badge:
const Icon = getCategoryIcon(product.features?.category);
<Icon className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
```

### Filter by Price Range

Add a price filter above category tabs:

```tsx
const [priceRange, setPriceRange] = useState<'all' | 'budget' | 'premium'>('all');

// Filter logic:
.filter(product => {
  if (priceRange === 'budget') return product.price_monthly < 50;
  if (priceRange === 'premium') return product.price_monthly >= 100;
  return true;
})
```

   - Use clear, customer-friendly category names

## Troubleshooting

### Categories Not Showing?

**Check:**
1. Products have `features.category` set
2. Products are `is_active = true`
3. Backend API is running
4. No browser console errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check products in database
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/billing-backend
sqlite3 billing.db "SELECT name, features FROM plans WHERE is_active = 1;"

# Make sure features JSON has category:
# {"category": "hosting", ...}
```

### Empty Category Tabs?

Categories only show if they have at least one active product.

**Solution:** Assign products to categories in dashboard:
1. Go to `/dashboard/products`
2. Edit product
3. Add category in features

### Products Not Grouped Correctly?

**Check category spelling** - must match exactly:
- ✅ `"hosting"` 
- ❌ `"Hosting"` (capital H)
- ❌ `"hosting "` (extra space)

### "All Products" Shows Nothing?

**Possible causes:**
1. No active products in database
2. API connection issue
3. Category loading failed

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Check for errors
// Should see: "Failed to load category products:" if API issue
```
