## The Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run This Command
```bash
sudo /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/fix-now.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Kills the stuck backend
- ‚úÖ Adds database columns (is_featured, sort_order)
- ‚úÖ Starts fresh backend on port 8000
- ‚úÖ Tests that it works

### Step 2: Restart Frontend

**Find the terminal running your frontend** (showing "npm run dev" or "next dev")

Then:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it
2. Run:
```bash
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/billing-frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Hard Refresh Browser

## üÜò If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/billing-backend
tail -f backend.log
```

Look for errors. Common issues:
- "Address in use" ‚Üí Port blocked, need to kill process
- "Module not found" ‚Üí Need to install dependencies
- "Database locked" ‚Üí Close other connections to database

### Verify Backend is Running:
```bash
ps aux | grep uvicorn
```
Should show process on port 8000.

### Test Backend Directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plans
```
Should return JSON with products.

### Nuclear Option (Complete Reset):
```bash
# Stop everything
sudo pkill -9 uvicorn
sudo pkill -9 node

# Backend
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/billing-backend
sqlite3 billing.db "ALTER TABLE plans ADD COLUMN is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;"
sqlite3 billing.db "ALTER TABLE plans ADD COLUMN sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0;"
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# In another terminal - Frontend
cd /home/saiful/nextpanel-bill/billing-frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
```
