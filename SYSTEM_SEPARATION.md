# System Separation - Billing vs NextPanel

## ✅ CORRECT Architecture Separation

### Billing System (Customer-Facing)
**Purpose**: Sell licenses, register domains, process payments
- ✅ Customer registration & login
- ✅ Stripe payment processing
- ✅ Domain registration (via registrar)
- ✅ License sales and management
- ✅ Invoicing
- ✅ Subscription management

### NextPanel (Hosting Control)
**Purpose**: Hosting control panel for license holders
- ✅ Manage websites/apps
- ✅ Create databases
- ✅ Email accounts
- ✅ File management
- ✅ DNS management (for already registered domains)
- ❌ NO domain registration
- ❌ NO Stripe/payment processing
- ❌ License validation only (checks with billing API)

## 🔄 How They Work Together

```
Customer Journey:
1. Visit Billing Website → Browse plans
2. Buy license via Stripe → Billing processes payment
3. Billing auto-registers domain (if purchased)
4. Billing creates NextPanel account via API
5. Customer receives NextPanel login credentials
6. Customer logs into NextPanel → Manages hosting
7. NextPanel validates license with Billing API before allowing actions
```

## 🔌 API Integration

```python
# NextPanel checks license BEFORE allowing any action
# billing-backend/app/api/v1/nextpanel.py

@router.post("/validate")
async def validate_license(license_key: str, feature: str):
    """
    NextPanel calls this to check if user can perform action
    """
    license = await get_license(license_key)
    
    if not license or not license.is_active:
        return {"valid": False, "error": "Invalid license"}
    
    if feature == "create_database":
        if license.current_databases >= license.max_databases:
            return {"valid": False, "error": "Database quota exceeded"}
    
    return {
        "valid": True,
        "remaining_quota": license.max_databases - license.current_databases
    }
```

## 📋 Feature Separation Table

| Feature | Billing System | NextPanel |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| User Registration | ✅ Customers | ✅ Hosting accounts (auto-created) |
| Payments | ✅ Stripe | ❌ No |
| Domain Registration | ✅ Via registrar API | ❌ No |
| Domain DNS Management | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (for registered domains) |
| License Sales | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| License Validation | ✅ Provides API | ✅ Consumes API |
| Website Hosting | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Database Creation | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (with quota check) |
| Email Accounts | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (with quota check) |
| Invoicing | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Support Tickets | ✅ Yes (billing issues) | ✅ Yes (technical issues) |

## 🔐 Security Separation

**Billing System**:
- Handles credit cards (via Stripe - PCI compliant)
- Stores customer financial data
- Isolated database
- Separate domain (e.g., billing.yourcompany.com)

**NextPanel**:
- NO access to payment data
- Only knows: "This user has license X with quotas Y"
- Separate database
- Separate domain (e.g., panel.yourcompany.com)

## 💡 Example Flow

### Scenario: Customer wants to host a website

**Wrong Way** ❌:
```
Customer → NextPanel → Tries to register domain
           ↓
        Fails (NextPanel shouldn't do this!)
```

**Right Way** ✅:
```
1. Customer → Billing Website → Registers domain + buys license
2. Billing → Processes payment via Stripe
3. Billing → Registers domain via Namecheap API
4. Billing → Calls NextPanel API to create hosting account
5. Billing → Sends email with NextPanel login
6. Customer → Logs into NextPanel → Manages website
7. NextPanel → Validates license with Billing API for each action
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Billing App = Front Office**
- Customer acquisition
- Sales and payments
- Domain registration/renewal
- License management

**NextPanel = Back Office**
- Hosting services
- Technical management
- License validation
- Resource usage

They are **separate systems** that communicate via **secure API**.

**Your instinct was 100% correct!** NextPanel should NOT have domain registration or Stripe. That's what the billing system is for. 🎯
