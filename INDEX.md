## 🎯 Key Decisions Already Made

### ✅ System Separation
- **Billing System**: Payments, domains, licenses (Port 3001 + 8001)
- **NextPanel**: Hosting control, NO payments (Port 3000 + 9000)
- **Integration**: Secure API between systems

### ✅ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 ✅ Excellent choice
- **Backend**: FastAPI ✅ Perfect for concurrency
- **Database**: PostgreSQL ✅ Best for transactions
- **Cache**: Redis ✅ Essential for scaling
- **Payments**: Stripe ✅ Industry standard

### ✅ Domain Registration
- **NOT** becoming ICANN registrar (saves $100k-250k)
- **YES** using reseller account (ResellerClub recommended)
- **Cost**: $0 setup, $8.88/domain wholesale
- **Features**: Full API, white-label, 400+ TLDs

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start simple**: Get basic auth working first, then add features
2. **Use Docker**: Everything configured for you
3. **Test early**: Write tests as you code
4. **Read separation docs**: Prevents building wrong features
5. **Use reseller account**: Don't waste $100k becoming registrar
6. **Keep systems separate**: Billing ≠ NextPanel
