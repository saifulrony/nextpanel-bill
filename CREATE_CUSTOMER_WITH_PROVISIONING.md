## 💡 Example Usage

### Creating a Customer with Hosting

**Customer Information:**
```
Email: john@example.com
Full Name: John Doe
Company: Acme Corp
Password: BillingPassword123!
Active: ✓
```

**Provisioning (Check the box):**
```
Hosting Username: johndoe
Hosting Password: HostingPassword123!
Server: Production Server (5/100)
```

**Click:** "Create & Provision"

**Result:**
```
✅ Customer created and hosting account provisioned successfully! 
   NextPanel User ID: 123
```

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### Smart Server Selection
- Shows server capacity: `Production Server (5/100)`
- Disables offline servers
- Auto-loads servers when you check the provisioning box

### Visual Feedback
- **Loading state:** "Creating..." during submission
- **Success message:** Shows NextPanel User ID
- **Error handling:** Clear error messages if something fails
- **Button text changes:** "Create Customer" vs "Create & Provision"

### Form Validation
- All required fields are validated
- Hosting fields only required if provisioning is enabled
- Prevents submission if servers are offline

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Servers Must Be Added First
If you check the provisioning box and see:
```
⚠️ No NextPanel servers available. Add a server first.
```

**Solution:** 
1. Cancel the modal
2. Go to **Server** page
3. Add your NextPanel server
4. Come back and try again

### 2. Separate Passwords
- **Password** = For billing system login
- **Hosting Password** = For NextPanel hosting login

These are **two different passwords** for two different systems!

### 3. NextPanel API Key Permissions
Make sure your NextPanel API key has:
- ✅ **Permission Level:** BILLING or SUPER_ADMIN
- ✅ **Allowed IPs:** `192.168.10.203, 127.0.0.1`
- ✅ **Scopes:** Account Management enabled

### 4. Partial Success Handling
If customer creation succeeds but provisioning fails:
```
✅ Customer created successfully, but provisioning failed. 
   You can provision later from customer details.
```

The customer is still created - you can provision manually later from the "Hosting" tab.

## ✅ Checklist for Success

Before using the provisioning feature, make sure:

- [ ] At least one NextPanel server is added and online
- [ ] NextPanel API key has proper permissions (BILLING/SUPER_ADMIN)

- [ ] Server has available capacity
- [ ] You have both passwords ready (billing + hosting)

---

## 🎓 Tips & Best Practices

### Username Suggestions
- Use customer email prefix: `john` from `john@example.com`
- Keep it simple and memorable
- No spaces or special characters

### Password Security
- Use strong passwords for both systems
- Consider using a password generator
- Store securely (password manager)

### Server Selection
- Choose server with lowest utilization
- Consider customer's geographic location
- Avoid servers that are >90% full

### When to Skip Provisioning
- Customer only needs billing access (no hosting)
- You want to provision later (maybe after payment)
- You're importing existing customers
- Server is under maintenance

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No NextPanel servers available"
**Fix:** Add a server first in the Server management page

### "Loading servers..." never completes
**Fix:** Check backend is running: `curl http://192.168.10.203:8001/health`

### Provisioning fails after customer creation
**Fix:** 
1. Customer is still created successfully
2. Go to customer details → Hosting tab
3. Manually provision from there
4. Check NextPanel API key permissions

### Server shows as "Offline"
**Fix:**
1. Check if NextPanel server is running
2. Test connection from Server management page
3. Update server status
