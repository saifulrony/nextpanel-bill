# Dashboard Real-Time Updates - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Updated the dashboard to match the /analytics page with real-time updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE), on-demand refresh, and live data change notifications.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Real-Time Updates with SSE

**Uses `useRealtimeUpdates` Hook:**
- Connects to `/api/v1/events/stream` endpoint
- Listens for real-time events:
  - `order_created` - New orders
  - `order_updated` - Order status changes
  - `payment_received` - Payment transactions
  - `data_change` - General data updates

**Auto-Refresh Triggers:**
- Automatically refetches dashboard stats when events occur
- No polling required
- Instant updates on data changes

### ✅ 2. On-Demand Refresh

**Manual Refresh Button:**
- Click "Refresh" button to fetch latest data
- Updates all stats immediately
- Shows loading state during refresh

**Keyboard Shortcut**: Works with button click

### ✅ 3. Real-Time Toggle

**Enable/Disable Real-Time:**
- Checkbox to toggle real-time updates
- When disabled: Manual refresh only
- When enabled: Auto-updates on events
- State persists during session

### ✅ 4. Live Status Indicators

**Connection Status:**
- Green "Live" badge when connected
- Gray "Disconnected" when offline
- Animated pulse icon when live
- Shows connection state in real-time

**Last Update Time:**
- Shows timestamp of last data fetch
- Updates automatically
- Format: `HH:MM:SS AM/PM`

### ✅ 5. Notification System

**Event Notifications:**
- Toast notifications for events
- Green success banner
- Bell icon animation
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

**Notification Types:**
- "New order received!"
- "Order status updated!"
- "Payment received!"

### ✅ 6. Force Re-Render on Data Change

**Key-Based Updates:**
- Each stat card has unique key with data value
- Forces React to detect changes
- Ensures UI updates immediately
- Timestamp-based root key for full refresh

**Example:**
```tsx
key={`total-customers-${stats?.total_customers}`}
key={`total-revenue-${stats?.total_revenue}`}
key={lastUpdate.getTime()}
```

## How It Works

### Real-Time Flow:

1. **User loads dashboard**
   - Connects to SSE endpoint
   - Fetches initial stats
   - Establishes WebSocket-like connection

2. **Event occurs** (new order/payment)
   - Backend broadcasts event via SSE
   - Frontend receives event
   - Shows notification
   - Auto-refetches stats
   - Updates UI with new data

3. **Data changes**
   - New object created with `_timestamp`
   - React detects change
   - Re-renders affected components
   - Smooth update transition

### Manual Refresh Flow:

1. **User clicks "Refresh"**
   - Calls `loadDashboardData()`
   - Fetches latest stats from API
   - Updates state
   - UI re-renders

## Components

### Stat Cards (20+ metrics):

**Customer Stats:**
- Total customers (with weekly growth)
- Active customers (with percentage)
- Recent signups (24 hours)
- Average customer value

**Product & License Stats:**
- Total products
- Total licenses
- Active licenses (with status breakdown)
- Active subscriptions

**Order & Revenue Stats:**
- Total orders (with today's count)
- Total revenue (all-time)
- Monthly revenue
- Weekly revenue

**Invoice & Domain Stats:**
- Total invoices (paid/unpaid breakdown)
- Overdue invoices (highlighted)
- Total domains
- Active domains

**Recent Activity:**
- New signups (24h)
- Payments received (24h)
- Orders placed (24h)

## UI Features

### Header Controls:
- **Last Update Time** - Shows when data was last fetched
- **Live Status Badge** - Connection indicator
- **Real-time Toggle** - Enable/disable auto-updates
- **Refresh Button** - Manual refresh trigger

### Notification Banner:
- Fixed position (top-right)
- Slide-in animation
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Green success styling

### Status Panel:
- Green panel when real-time enabled
- Blue panel when manual mode
- Explains current mode
- Icon-based visual feedback

## API Integration

### Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats`

**Returns all stats in single call:**
```typescript
{
  total_customers, active_customers, new_customers_this_month,
  new_customers_this_week, recent_signups,
  total_products, active_products,
  total_licenses, active_licenses, suspended_licenses, expired_licenses,
  total_subscriptions, active_subscriptions,
  total_orders, pending_orders, completed_orders, recent_orders,
  total_revenue, monthly_revenue, weekly_revenue, recent_payments,
  total_invoices, paid_invoices, unpaid_invoices, overdue_invoices,
  total_domains, active_domains
}
```

### SSE Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/events/stream`

**Event Types:**
- `connected` - Initial connection
- `order_created` - New order
- `order_updated` - Status change
- `payment_received` - Payment completed
- `heartbeat` - Keep-alive ping
- `data_change` - General update

## Performance

### Optimizations:
- Single API call for all stats
- Async data fetching
- Memoized callbacks
- Efficient re-rendering
- Key-based updates

### Network Usage:
- No polling (uses SSE)
- Push-based updates
- Minimal bandwidth
- Instant notifications

## Benefits

### For Administrators:
✅ Real-time visibility into system activity
