# 🏢 Master Reseller System - Multi-Tier Reselling Explained

## 🎯 **Your Question:**

> "If I create a master reseller or admin using the billing system, who will be able to sell the reseller accounts?"

---

## 📊 **Understanding the Hierarchy:**

### **Current System (2-Tier):**

```
YOU (Super Admin)
    ↓
    Creates
    ↓
┌────────────────┐
│   Reseller     │  ← is_admin: true
│   (Partner)    │
└───────┬────────┘
        ↓
        Creates
        ↓
    ┌───────┐
    │Customer│  ← is_admin: false
    │Customer│
    │Customer│
    └───────┘
```

**Current Reseller Can:**
- ✅ Create hosting customers
- ❌ Cannot create other resellers

---

### **Proposed System (3-Tier Master Reseller):**

```
YOU (Super Admin)
    ↓
    Creates
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Master Reseller    │  ← NEW! Can sell reseller accounts
│  (Agency/Partner)   │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           ↓
           Creates
           ↓
    ┌──────────────┐
    │  Reseller    │  ← Can sell hosting to customers
    │  Reseller    │
    └──────┬───────┘
           ↓
           Creates
           ↓
       ┌────────┐
       │Customer│  ← End hosting customers
       │Customer│
       └────────┘
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Example:**

### **Scenario:**

**You** (Super Admin) run the hosting company

**Master Reseller** (Web Agency):
- Name: "WebAgency Pro"
- Buys: Master Reseller plan ($500/month)
- Can: Create and sell reseller accounts
- Target: Small web design companies

**Sub-Reseller** (Created by WebAgency):
- Name: "Bob's Web Design"
- Pays: $100/month to WebAgency Pro
- Can: Create hosting accounts for their clients
- Target: Local small businesses

**End Customer** (Created by Bob):
- Name: "Joe's Pizza Shop"
- Pays: $10/month to Bob's Web Design
- Gets: Hosting account
- Uses: Website for their pizza shop

**Money Flow:**
```
Joe's Pizza → $10/mo → Bob's Web Design
Bob's Web Design → $100/mo → WebAgency Pro  
WebAgency Pro → $500/mo → YOU

Your revenue: $500/mo
WebAgency profit: $400/mo (if they sell 5 resellers at $100 each)
Bob's profit: $50/mo (if they sell 5 customers at $12 each)
```

## 🏗️ **How to Implement This:**

### **Option 1: Add Reseller Tier Field (RECOMMENDED)**

**Database Change:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN reseller_tier INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Tiers:
-- 0 = Regular customer
-- 1 = Reseller (can create customers)
-- 2 = Master Reseller (can create resellers)
-- 3 = Super Admin (can create master resellers)
```

**Business Logic:**
```python
def can_create_user(creator, new_user_tier):
    if creator.is_super_admin:
        return True  # Can create anyone
    
    if creator.reseller_tier >= 2:  # Master reseller
        return new_user_tier <= 1  # Can create resellers and customers
    
    if creator.reseller_tier >= 1:  # Regular reseller
        return new_user_tier == 0  # Can only create customers
    
    return False  # Regular users can't create accounts
```

---

### **Option 2: Use Existing is_admin Field (SIMPLER)**

**Keep current structure, add permissions check:**

```python
# Master resellers are just admins created by super admin
# Regular resellers are admins created by master resellers

def can_create_reseller(user):
    # Only super admins and master resellers can create resellers
    return user.is_super_admin or (user.is_admin and user.created_by_id == SUPER_ADMIN_ID)

def can_create_customer(user):
    # Any admin can create customers
    return user.is_admin or user.is_super_admin
```

**Billing System Logic:**
```
If customer buying "Master Reseller" plan:
  → Create via your super admin account
  → is_admin: true
  → created_by: YOU
  → Can create: Resellers + Customers

If customer buying "Reseller" plan:
  → Create via master reseller account
  → is_admin: true
  → created_by: Master Reseller ID
  → Can create: Customers only
```

---

### **Option 3: Permission-Based System (MOST FLEXIBLE)**

**Add permissions table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_permissions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    permission VARCHAR(50),
    
    -- Permissions:
    -- 'create_customers'
    -- 'create_resellers'
    -- 'create_master_resellers'
    -- 'manage_billing'
    -- 'view_all_customers'
);
```

**Check permissions:**
```python
if user.has_permission('create_resellers'):
    # Can create reseller accounts
    allow_reseller_creation()
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach for YOU:**

### **Use a 4-Tier System with Simple Logic:**

| Tier | Name | is_admin | is_super_admin | created_by | Can Create |
|------|------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **4** | Super Admin | true | true | NULL | Master Resellers, Resellers, Customers |
| **3** | Master Reseller | true | false | Super Admin | Resellers, Customers |
| **2** | Reseller | true | false | Master Reseller | Customers only |
| **1** | Customer | false | false | Anyone | Nothing |

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_user_tier(user, db):
    """Determine user tier based on flags and relationships"""
    if user.is_super_admin:
        return 4  # Super Admin
    
    if not user.is_admin:
        return 1  # Regular customer
    
    # Check who created this admin
    creator = db.query(User).filter(User.id == user.created_by_id).first()
    
    if creator and creator.is_super_admin:
        return 3  # Master Reseller (created by super admin)
    else:
        return 2  # Regular Reseller (created by master reseller)

def can_create_reseller(user, db):
    """Check if user can create reseller accounts"""
    tier = get_user_tier(user, db)
    return tier >= 3  # Super admin or master reseller
```

## 🔐 **Security Considerations:**

### **Who Can Create What:**

**Super Admin (YOU):**
- ✅ Create master resellers (manually or via billing)
- ✅ Create resellers
- ✅ Create customers
- ✅ Full system access

**Master Reseller:**
- ✅ Create resellers (sub-resellers)
- ✅ Create customers
- ❌ Cannot create other master resellers
- ❌ Cannot create super admins
- ⚠️ Can see their resellers + all sub-customers

**Reseller:**
- ✅ Create customers only
- ❌ Cannot create resellers
- ❌ Cannot create master resellers
- ⚠️ Can see only their own customers

**Customer:**
- ❌ Cannot create any accounts
- ✅ Can only manage their own resources

---

## 🎯 **How Master Resellers Sell Reseller Accounts:**

### **Process:**

**1. You Create Master Reseller:**
```
Via billing system:
  - Create customer "WebAgency Pro"
  - Select product: "Master Reseller Starter"
  - Provision as master reseller (is_admin: true, created_by: YOU)
```

**2. Master Reseller Logs Into Their Panel:**
```
URL: http://your-nextpanel.com/reseller
Access: Can see "Create Reseller" option
```

**3. Master Reseller Creates Sub-Reseller:**
```
Via their panel:
  - Create new reseller account
  - Assign package limits
  - Send credentials to sub-reseller
```

**4. Sub-Reseller Creates Customers:**
```
Sub-reseller logs in
Creates hosting accounts for their clients
Manages their customer base
```

---

## 📊 **Revenue Model:**

### **Example Pricing:**

```
YOU sell to Master Reseller:
  Master Reseller plan: $500/mo
  Allows: 10 sub-resellers
  
Master Reseller sells to Resellers:
  Reseller plan: $100/mo each
  Revenue: 10 × $100 = $1000/mo
  Profit: $1000 - $500 = $500/mo
  
Resellers sell to Customers:
  Hosting: $10/mo each
  If each reseller gets 20 customers
  Revenue: 20 × $10 = $200/mo per reseller
  Profit: $200 - $100 = $100/mo per reseller
```

---

## ✅ **To Implement Master Resellers:**

### **Simple Approach (No Database Changes):**

**Use `created_by` field:**

```python
# In NextPanel backend
def can_user_create_resellers(user, db):
    """Check if user can create reseller accounts"""
    if user.is_super_admin:
        return True  # Super admin can create anyone
    
    if not user.is_admin:
        return False  # Regular users can't create accounts
    
    # Check if this admin was created by super admin
    if user.created_by_id:
        creator = db.query(User).filter(User.id == user.created_by_id).first()
        if creator and creator.is_super_admin:
            return True  # Master reseller (created by super admin)
    
    return False  # Regular reseller (cannot create other resellers)
```

**In UI (Reseller Panel):**
```typescript
// Show "Create Reseller" button only if user can create resellers
{userCanCreateResellers && (
  <button>Create Sub-Reseller</button>
)}
```

---

## 🎯 **Quick Answer:**

**Question:** Who can sell reseller accounts?  

**Answer:**  
**Master Resellers** - These are special admins who:
- Were created by YOU (super admin)
- Have `is_admin: true`
- Have `created_by: YOUR_ID`
- Can create both resellers AND customers
- Higher tier than regular resellers

**How to Create:**
1. You create them via billing system
2. You select "Master Reseller" plan
3. They get is_admin: true
4. Their created_by points to you
5. System detects: "Created by super admin = Master Reseller"
6. They can now create reseller accounts!

## ✅ **Current Status:**

**UI:** ✅ Product selection moved below and made optional  
**Backend:** ✅ Supports is_admin flag for resellers  
**Master Reseller Logic:** ⚠️ Needs implementation
