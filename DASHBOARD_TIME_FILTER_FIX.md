# Dashboard Time Period Filter Fix - Complete

## Issue
All time period filters (today, yesterday, week, month, year, custom) were showing the same data on the dashboard because the main stats endpoint didn't support period filtering.

## Root Cause
The `/dashboard/stats` endpoint in the backend was returning all-time statistics regardless of the selected time period. Only the customer analytics section was being filtered.

### Before
```typescript
// Frontend was calling:
api.get('/dashboard/stats')  // ❌ No period parameter
api.get(`/dashboard/customers/analytics?period=${timePeriod}`)  // ✅ Had period
```

```python
# Backend endpoint had:
@router.get("/stats", response_model=DashboardStatsResponse)
async def get_dashboard_stats(
    user_info: tuple = Depends(verify_user_or_admin),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    # No period parameters - always returned all-time data
```

## Solution

### Backend Changes (billing-backend/app/api/v1/dashboard.py)

1. **Added period parameters to the stats endpoint:**
   ```python
   @router.get("/stats", response_model=DashboardStatsResponse)
   async def get_dashboard_stats(
       period: str = Query("week", regex="^(today|yesterday|week|month|year|custom)$"),
       start_date: Optional[datetime] = None,
       end_date: Optional[datetime] = None,
       user_info: tuple = Depends(verify_user_or_admin),
       db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
   ):
   ```

2. **Added date range calculation based on period:**
   - `today`: From midnight today to now
   - `yesterday`: Full day yesterday
   - `week`: Last 7 days
   - `month`: Last 30 days
   - `year`: Last 365 days
   - `custom`: User-specified start and end dates

3. **Applied period filtering to ALL statistics:**
   - ✅ Customer stats (total, active, new)
   - ✅ License stats (total, active, suspended, expired)
   - ✅ Subscription stats (total, active, cancelled)
   - ✅ Order/Payment stats (total, pending, completed)
   - ✅ Revenue stats (total, monthly, weekly)
   - ✅ Invoice stats (total, paid, unpaid, overdue)
   - ✅ Domain stats (total, active)

### Frontend Changes (billing-frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx)

**Updated API call to pass period parameter:**
```typescript
// Build query params for both endpoints
let params = `period=${timePeriod}`;
if (timePeriod === 'custom' && customStartDate && customEndDate) {
  params += `&start_date=${customStartDate}&end_date=${customEndDate}`;
}

const [statsResponse, customersResponse] = await Promise.all([
  api.get(`/dashboard/stats?${params}`),  // ✅ Now includes period
  api.get(`/dashboard/customers/analytics?${params}`),  // ✅ Already had period
]);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User selects a time period** (today, yesterday, week, month, year, or custom)
2. **Frontend sends period parameter** to both endpoints
3. **Backend filters all queries** using `.between(period_start, period_end)`
4. **Statistics reflect the selected time period** only

### Example Queries Generated

**Today:**
```sql
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-10-12 00:00:00' AND '2025-10-12 07:20:00'
```

**Week:**
```sql
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-10-05 07:20:00' AND '2025-10-12 07:20:00'
```

**Custom (e.g., Jan 1-31, 2025):**
```sql
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2025-01-31 23:59:59'
```

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Open the dashboard** in your browser
2. **Select different time periods** from the dropdown
3. **Observe the statistics change** for each period:
   - Today should show fewer numbers than week
   - Yesterday should show data only from yesterday
   - Year should show the most data
4. **Try custom date range** to see specific period data

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The dashboard now correctly filters all statistics based on the selected time period.

### Files Modified
- ✅ `/billing-backend/app/api/v1/dashboard.py` - Added period filtering to stats endpoint
- ✅ `/billing-frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Pass period to stats endpoint

### Services Restarted
- ✅ Backend container restarted to apply changes
- ✅ Frontend automatically hot-reloaded

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** to see the changes
2. **Test all time period options** to ensure they work correctly
3. The numbers should now be different for each time period based on actual data in those periods
