## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Database Tables:**
- `chat_sessions` - Chat session tracking
- `chat_messages` - Individual messages
- `support_tickets` - Support tickets (existing)
- `ticket_replies` - Ticket responses (existing)

### **AI Bot Patterns:**
Uses regex pattern matching with 10+ categories:
```python
- Greeting patterns: hello, hi, hey
- Pricing patterns: price, cost, plan
- Support patterns: help, problem, issue
- Payment patterns: payment, billing, invoice
... and more
```

### **Auto-refresh:**
- Live chat page refreshes every 10 seconds
- Only active chats trigger message refresh
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

### **Security:**
- Chat stats: Public access (no auth required)
- Chat sessions list: Shows only user's own sessions (unless admin)
- Ticket creation: Requires authentication
- Admin features: Requires is_admin flag in JWT

---

## ⚠️ Important: Authentication

**If you see 403 errors on dashboard or chat pages:**

### **Quick Fix:**
```javascript
// In browser console (F12 → Console):
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### **Then:**
1. Log back in with your admin account
2. You'll get a fresh JWT token with `is_admin` flag
3. All dashboard and chat features will work

**Why?** The JWT token structure was updated to include the `is_admin` flag. Old tokens don't have this and cause 403 errors.
